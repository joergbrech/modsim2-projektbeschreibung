  Abstract                 = {A new strategy for the determination of force parameters is presented. The equilibrium values appearing in the force field equations representing the “stretching” and “bending” of bonds are directly determined from quantum mechanical calculations without geometrical restrictions. The determination of the force parameters is carried out by means of a rigorous fitting between the quantum mechanic and the molecular mechanical energy variations arising from the perturbation of the geometric variables. The strategy presented here has been incorporated into a computer program named PAPQMD, which was developed in order to provide nonquantum mechanical experts with a powerful tool for the determination of approximate force parameters. The program was developed upon the assumption that force parameters are not universal, but they strongly depend on the molecular environment. This implies that the parametrization procedure should be done in a molecular model close to the molecule or molecules to be studied by means of molecular mechanical or dynamic methods, and consequently, it is no longer supposed that the variation of one geometrical parameter does not affect the rest of the molecular geometry. PAPQMD performs the fitting between molecular mechanics and quantum mechanical energies considering all the perturbations that the modification in one geometric variable causes in all the others, enabling the parametrization even of large molecules. The ability of our method to reproduce experimentally derived force parameters is discussed and compared with the widely used Hopfinger's strategy. The study of the behavior of PAPQMD and Hopfinger's strategies for reproducing the force parameters of two complex molecules demonstrates the superiority of the methodology presented here.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular simulations are an important tool in the study of aqueous salt solutions. To predict the physical properties accurately and reliably, the molecular models must be tailored to reproduce experimental data. In this work, a combination of recent global and local optimization tools is used to derive force fields for MgCl2 (aq) and CaCl2 (aq). The molecular models for the ions are based on a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential with a superimposed point charge. The LJ parameters are adjusted to reproduce the bulk density and shear viscosity of the different solutions at 1 bar and temperatures of 293.15, 303.15, and 318.15 K. It is shown that the $\sigma$-value of chloride consistently has the strongest influence on the system properties. The optimized force field for MgCl2 (aq) provides both properties in good agreement with the experimental data over a wide range of salt concentrations. For CaCl2 (aq), a compromise was made between the bulk density and shear viscosity, since reproducing the two properties requires two different choices of the LJ parameters. This is demonstrated by studying metamodels of the simulated data, which are generated to visualize the correlation between the parameters and observables by using projection plots. Consequently, in order to derive a transferable force field, an error of ∼3{\%} on the bulk density has to be tolerated to yield the shear viscosity in satisfactory agreement with experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {A central goal of molecular simulations is to predict physical or chemical properties such that costly and elaborate experiments can be minimized. The reliable generation of molecular models is a critical issue to do so. Hence, striving for semiautomated and fully automated parameterization of entire force fields for molecular simulations, the authors developed several modular program packages in recent years. The programs run with limited user interactions and can be executed in parallel on modern computer clusters. Various interlinked resolutions of molecular modeling are addressed: For intramolecular interactions, a force-field optimization package named Wolf2Pack has been developed that transfers knowledge gained from quantum mechanics to Newtonian-based molecular models. For intermolecular interactions, especially Lennard--Jones parameters, a modular optimization toolkit of programs and scripts has been created combining global and local optimization algorithms. Global optimization is performed by a tool named CoSMoS, while local optimization is done by the gradient-based optimization workflow named GROW or by a derivative-free method called SpaGrOW. The overall goal of all program packages is to realize an easy, efficient, and user-friendly development of reliable force-field parameters in a reasonable time. The various tools are needed and interlinked since different stages of the optimization process demand different courses of action. In this paper, the conception of all programs involved is presented and how they communicate with each other.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular modeling is an important subdomain in the field of computational modeling, regarding both scientific and industrial applications. This is because computer simulations on a molecular level are a virtuous instrument to study the impact of microscopic on macroscopic phenomena. Accurate molecular models are indispensable for such simulations in order to predict physical target observables, like density, pressure, diffusion coefficients or energetic properties, quantitatively over a wide range of temperatures. Thereby, molecular interactions are described mathematically by force fields. The mathematical description includes parameters for both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. While intramolecular force field parameters can be determined by quantum mechanics, the parameterization of the intermolecular part is often tedious. Recently, an empirical procedure, based on the minimization of a loss function between simulated and experimental physical properties, was published by the authors. Thereby, efficient gradient-based numerical optimization algorithms were used. However, empirical force field optimization is inhibited by the two following central issues appearing in molecular simulations: firstly, they are extremely time-consuming, even on modern and high-performance computer clusters, and secondly, simulation data is affected by statistical noise. The latter provokes the fact that an accurate computation of gradients or Hessians is nearly impossible close to a local or global minimum, mainly because the loss function is flat. Therefore, the question arises of whether to apply a derivative-free method approximating the loss function by an appropriate model function. In this paper, a new Sparse Grid-based Optimization Workflow (SpaGrOW) is presented, which accomplishes this task robustly and, at the same time, keeps the number of time-consuming simulations relatively small. This is achieved by an efficient sampling procedure for the approximation based on sparse grids, which is described in full detail: in order to counteract the fact that sparse grids are fully occupied on their boundaries, a mathematical transformation is applied to generate homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. As the main drawback of sparse grids methods is the assumption that the function to be modeled exhibits certain smoothness properties, it has to be approximated by smooth functions first. Radial basis functions turned out to be very suitable to solve this task. The smoothing procedure and the subsequent interpolation on sparse grids are performed within sufficiently large compact trust regions of the parameter space. It is shown and explained how the combination of the three ingredients leads to a new efficient derivative-free algorithm, which has the additional advantage that it is capable of reducing the overall number of simulations by a factor of about two in comparison to gradient-based optimization methods. At the same time, the robustness with respect to statistical noise is maintained. This assertion is proven by both theoretical considerations and practical evaluations for molecular simulations on chemical example substances.},

  Abstract                 = {GROMACS 3.0 is the latest release of a versatile and very well optimized package for molecular simulation. Much effort has been devoted to achieving extremely high performance on both workstations and parallel computers. The design includes an extraction of virial and periodic boundary conditions from the loops over pairwise interactions, and special software routines to enable rapid calculation of x--1/2. Inner loops are generated automatically in C or Fortran at compile time, with optimizations adapted to each architecture. Assembly loops using SSE and 3DNow! Multimedia instructions are provided for x86 processors, resulting in exceptional performance on inexpensive PC workstations. The interface is simple and easy to use (no scripting language), based on standard command line arguments with self-explanatory functionality and integrated documentation. All binary files are independent of hardware endian and can be read by versions of GROMACS compiled using different floating-point precision. A large collection of flexible tools for trajectory analysis is included, with output in the form of finished Xmgr/Grace graphs. A basic trajectory viewer is included, and several external visualization tools can read the GROMACS trajectory format. Starting with version 3.0, GROMACS is available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.gromacs.org.},

  Abstract                 = {GROMACS is a widely used package for biomolecular simulation, and over the last two decades it has evolved from small-scale efficiency to advanced heterogeneous acceleration and multi-level parallelism targeting some of the largest supercomputers in the world. Here, we describe some of the ways we have been able to realize this through the use of parallelization on all levels, combined with a constant focus on absolute performance. Release 4.6 of GROMACS uses SIMD acceleration on a wide range of architectures, GPU offloading acceleration, and both OpenMP and MPI parallelism within and between nodes, respectively. The recent work on acceleration made it necessary to revisit the fundamental algorithms of molecular simulation, including the concept of neighborsearching, and we discuss the present and future challenges we see for exascale simulation - in particular a very fine-grained task parallelism. We also discuss the software management, code peer review and continuous integration testing required for a project of this complexity.},

The apparatus allows relative density measurements to be carried out routinely with ppm precision, on 5--7 cm3 of solution, in a total time ranging between 5 to 10 min. The results of various tests reported here show the densimeter to be useful for investigation in aqueous as well as nonaqueous media; it is particularly well adapted to accurate measurements of small density increments, as required in excess-volume studies. Since the instrument operates in the flow regime, it is also adaptable to on-line monitoring of density in continuous processes.},

  Abstract                 = { While quantum chemical simulations have been increasingly used as an invaluable source of information for atomistic model development, the high computational expenses typically associated with these techniques often limit thorough sampling of the systems of interest. It is therefore of great practical importance to use all available information as efficiently as possible, and in a way that allows for consistent addition of constraints that may be provided by macroscopic experiments. Here we propose a simple approach that combines information from configurational energies and forces generated in a molecular dynamics simulation to increase the effective number of samples. Subsequently, this information is used to optimize a molecular force field by minimizing the statistical distance similarity metric. We illustrate the methodology on an example of a trajectory of configurations generated in equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of argon and water and compare the results with those based on the force matching method. },
